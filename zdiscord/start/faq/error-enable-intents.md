# Error: ENABLE INTENTS

The bot needs **Presence**, **Server Members** and **Message Content** Intents from the discord bot [settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to be enabled for the application. Under the "Bot" section of your discord bot application settings there's a section called "Privileged Gateway Intents". You just want to tick them all on and "Save Changes" like the image below and restart zdiscord and it will fix this error.

{% hint style="info" %}
While not all functionality may be used for all bots, it's just easier to include them all since it doesn't make a difference and makes it easier for everyone.
