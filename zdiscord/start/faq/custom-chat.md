# Custom Chat

You really shouldn't use a custom chat (according to cfx) but rather theme the default chat resource instead. If you did anyways though, you can change the functionality of the chat in zdiscord by modifying the function `chatMessage` in `utils.js` as all messages in game are forwarded through there
